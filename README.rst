Víctor Terrón's .emacs.d
========================

These are my Emacs configuration files. Hopefully they will be of any help to somebody in an undetermined point of the future. If the unlikely event you want to use them, then do this:

* Backup your `~/.emacs` and `~/.emacs.d` files!
* `git clone git://github.com/vterron/dot-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d`
* `ln -s ~/.emacs.d/vterron-init.el ~/.emacs`
