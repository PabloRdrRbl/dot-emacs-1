;; The various ways of sanely setting "unusual" keybindings (like
;; M-left and C-Home and such) tend not to work for terminal Emacs.
;; We need to actually figure out what string of characters the
;; terminal emulator is sending to Emacs and bind the function to
;; those. This function returns the right value (the terminal
;; equivalent) for the string representation of a keystroke.
